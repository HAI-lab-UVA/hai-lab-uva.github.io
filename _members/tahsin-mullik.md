Tahsin's research interest lies in the confluence of artificial intelligence and human mental health analysis and prediction. His research looks into the role of passive mobile and fitness sensors in developing the MoodRing application for detecting and predicting changes in adolescent depression. The aim of the project is to enable patients, caregivers, and parents with early intervention alerts to prevent the worsening of symptoms. This project is a reflection of the lab's goals to promote health and well being through intelligent learning of patterns and trends.

Tahsin graduated with his PhD in Systems Engineering in Summer 2024.
