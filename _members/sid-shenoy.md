Sid's research was focused on Human-Robot-Interaction using emotion recognition and adaptation in humanoid robots. He was particularly interested in using these adaptive humanoid robots for applications such as pain management in children, mental health wellbeing, and fighting loneliness. He used reinforcement learning methods along with facial expression recognition and voice quality analysis for emotion recognition. With the help of these adaptation methods, he hoped to explore the capabilities of these robots for detecting unique individual patterns and behaviors for improvement in health outcomes and positive interactions with members of our community. 

Since graduating with his PhD in Computer Engineering in Spring 2023, Sid has gone on to join the National Academy of Engineering as an Associate Program Officer.
