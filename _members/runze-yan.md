Runze is working towards developing a computational framework for automated discovery and modeling of human rhythms. This project aims to understand the complex principles behind the physical and psychological abnormalities of human bodies, to plan life schedules, and avoid persisting fatigue and mood and sleep alterations due to the desynchronization of those rhythms. 

Since graduating with his PhD in Systems Engineering in Spring 2023, Runze has gone on to join Emory University as a Postdoctoral Researcher.
