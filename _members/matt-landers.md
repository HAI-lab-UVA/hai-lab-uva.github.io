I am a computer science PhD student at the University of Virginia studying under Dr. Afsaneh Doryab in the Human-Artificial Intelligence Technology Lab. Previously, I earned my master's degree from Johns Hopkins University where I was advised by Dr. Suchi Saria. I have founded two startups. My research focuses on trustworthy deep reinforcement learning approaches designed for complex, real-world systems. I am especially interested in methods that can account for environmental constraints, human feedback, and other types of domain knowledge.
