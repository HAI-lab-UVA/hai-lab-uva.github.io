I work on computational modeling of human behavior from data streams collected through mobile, wearable, and embedded sensors. Examples of my work in the health domain include detection of behavior change in people with depression, predicting mania-depression episodes in bipolar disorder, estimation of symptom severity in cancer patients, and modeling of surgical activities inside the operating room. 

I also work on intelligent applications for social good. My recent work in Context-aware Peer-to-Peer economic exchange is focused on connecting communities of people through mobile technology to enable successful and meaningful service transactions, especially in low-income communities. In my research, I draw on methods from Machine Learning, Data Mining, Statistics, and Human-Computer Interaction.
