Connected Steps is a project designed to promote regular physical activity and foster social interaction. By encouraging individuals to walk with others, the project aims to reduce physical inactivity and social isolation. With an app developed to help users pair up and participate in co-walking activities, it motivates them to walk together, enhancing engagement and building further social connections.
