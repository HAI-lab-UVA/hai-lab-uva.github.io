Micronutrient imbalance is a global issue with major downstream health effects. On top of this, the detection of one's micronutrient status is invasive and expensive, often requiring a blood draw and complex laboratory tests. Our project explores new, more accessible ways of assessing the levels of vitamins and minerals in your body. Developments in accessible micronutrient assessment are necessary to properly understand and address the burden of micronutrient malnutrition in underserved populations.
