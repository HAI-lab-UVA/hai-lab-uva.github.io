Mass casualty incidents (MCIs) are a growing concern. Recent efforts to improve the MCI emergency medical response focus on resource allocation, responder coordination, or transportation efficiency, and often overlook the initial, yet critical, step of tagging victims on scene. Tagging victims in minimal time is vital in providing information that guides subsequent time-constrained response actions. In this group we are designing practical algorithms to optimize the time it takes for medical responders to tag victims, while considering real-world constraints such as global vs. local communication.
