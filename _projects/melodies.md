Hearing music activates unique parts of the brain, which are commonly associated with triggering emotions. Melodies investigates whether this connection can be leveraged to help people better internalize their wellbeing. We seek to develop new sonification methods to embed wellness information into music, and deploy them with participants to determine whether they can successfully prompte healthier behavior.
